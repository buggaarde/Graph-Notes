;;;; Schemas:
(defvar graph-notes-db--tags-schema
  '([(id integer :primary-key)
	 file-name])
  "The table containing all graph-note tags.

The table also contains the name of the file representing the tag.")

(defvar graph-notes-db--links-schema
  '([(id integer :primary-key)
	 (from-tag-id integer)
	 (to-tag-id integer)]
	(:foreign-key [from-tag-id] :references tags [id])
	(:foreign-key [to-tag-id] :references tags [id]))
  "The table connects all links between tags.")

(defvar graph-notes-db--synonyms-schema
  '([(id integer :primary-key)
	 name
	 (tag-id integer)]
	(:foreign-key [tag-id] :references tags [id]))
  "The table associates string names with the more abstract foreign-key tag id.")
